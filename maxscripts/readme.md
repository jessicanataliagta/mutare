v0.1.

GTA3D PED Auto Rig script for 3ds max - wip.

One-click auto rig automatically creates GTA3D PED skel and skin, adapted with GTA3D skeleton standard system (based on RWIO/LIBRW. Only GTA SA is supported atm).

External data script (GTASAPEDData.ms) must be in same folder as the main script (GTA3DPEDBones.ms).

Tested on 3ds Max 2026 (should work on 2017+ versions).

Known bug: doesn't work with GTA SA ragdoll mod.
